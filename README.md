mbient streaming through bluetooth in js

Need this to work on MacOS

# Usage

1. Install dependencies `npm install`

2. `index.js` is the entry of the application, it calls `lib/engine.js` to start the mbient communication channel.

3. Customize `lib/engine.js` for other functionalities. The codes are self-explainable. Now only the streaming mode using accelerometers are implemented.
